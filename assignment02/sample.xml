        He shot himself in the pond in the back of Sideview 
        when he found that he was terminally ill. It has also 
        been claimed that he was having money and wife 
        troubles. (He and Zelda did not get along and he was 
        embarrassed to have  married her.) It has further been 
        claimed that this was part of the Anderson family 
        curse.

          Samuel English Anderson was known in Montgomery 
          County for his red hair and the temper that went 
          with it. He did once <strong>kill a man</strong>, 
          but the court found that it was in self-defense. 
        </p>

        <p>
          He was shot by a farm worker whom he had 
          fired the day before for smoking in a tobacco barn.
          Hamp says this may have been self-defense, because he 
          threatened to kill the workers for smoking in the 
          barn. He also says old-time rumors say they mashed 
          his head with  a fence post. Beth heard he was cut to 
          death with machetes in the field, but Hamp says they 
          wouldn't be cutting tobacco in November, only 
          stripping it in the barn.

        <p>Yale 1869 (did not graduate)</p>
        <p>Breeder of short horn cattle</p>
        <p>He was named after an Ohio senator. The name Corwin 
          is from the Latin <i>corvinus</i> which means 
       <i>raven</i> and is akin to <i>corbin</i>/<i>corbet</i>. 
         In old French it was <i>cord</i> and in Middle English 
         <i>Corse</i> which meant <i>raven</i> or <i>cow</i>.
        </p>
        <p>Attended Annapolis for one year, possibly to 
          avoid service in the Civil War.</p>
        <p>He farmed the old Mitchell farm
          and became known as a leading short horn breeder. 
          He suffered from asthma and wanted to move to 
          Colorado in 1876 to avoid the Kentucky weather, but 
          he didn't.
